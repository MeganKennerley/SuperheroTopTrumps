# SuperheroTopTrumps
This is a Top Trumps game I have made using Python. It randomly choses a superhero character card for both the player and the computer. The player can then chose which power stat they want to play. 

'DataCollection' is the file which collects the character info from the API
'Superheros - Filter' is the file with all the Superhero character cards which have been taken from the API and filtered manually by me
'SuperheroTopTrumps' is the main game
